# Guitar Inventory System

This project embodies advanced object-oriented principles in C#, focusing on generic use of inheritance and class abstraction. It provides a flexible and extensible guitar inventory system where classes are designed to leverage inheritance for reusability and maintainability. This version of the project applies concepts from Chapter 5 of the book *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design*.

## Features

- **Add Instruments**: Seamlessly add various types of instruments to the inventory.
- **Search Capabilities**: Conduct refined searches based on specific criteria for different types of instruments.
- **Comprehensive Specifications**: Present detailed specifications of each instrument with precision.
- **Flexible Design**: Utilizes inheritance to allow for the extension of different instrument types beyond guitars.

## Technologies Used

- **C# Programming Language**: Leveraging modern object-oriented features.
- **.NET Framework**: Provides a robust framework for building and running applications.
